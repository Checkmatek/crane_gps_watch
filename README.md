Installation:
-------------

This program uses libxml2. Please install libxml2 before building Crane GPS Watch client.

Crane GPS Watch client uses make to build:

1. Download source code archive from githup repo:

  git clone https://github.com/mru00/crane_gps_watch.git

2. cd to unpacking directory
3. build the software 

  ./configure && make

4. install

  make install


USAGE:
------

	crane_gps_watch_client --help      show the help screen

	crane_gps_watch_client 
    [--output "filename"]            override default filename
    [--split]                        write file for each track
    [--device "/dev/tty..."]         override default device file
    [--to_image filename]            write watch data to file <for testing>
    [--from_image filename]          read watch data from file <for testing>
    [--verbose]                      write debug output to console

As default, the output file is written in the current working directory.
The filename is created from the current time and date. Use the `--output` option
to specify a different filename.

The `--device` option is used to specify the device file, default is '/dev/ttyUSB0'.

`--split` makes the program write a single .tcx for every track currently stored on the watch.
Default is to write a single .tcx file that contains all tracks. When this option is used, the `--output` option 
is ignored. The files are written in the current directory. The filename is taken from the start time of the workout track.
If a file already exists, it will be overwritten.

Resulting track file in tcx format you can convert into gpx format 
by means of gpsbabel or use tcx format as it is.

Enjoy!
